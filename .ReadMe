## Reasoning for your choice of automation software and reporting :
- I have used TestNG framework beacuse it supports test parallelization, test prioritization, data-driven testing, 
  grouping of test methods, and the ability to run tests with different configurations.
- And for the reporting purpose TestNG generates detailed HTML reports by default, making it easy to 
  track test execution results, identify failed tests, and view logs.  
- I have also use Userdata.properties file beacuse it helps in  Separation of Test Data,
  Ease of Maintenance, Reusability, Readability and also we can do customization.
- This code can run in various CI/CD pipeline.
- In this code we can also make Objectrepo file to store weblelements, so that the code will be easy to read
  but in this code for now i have not added, but it can be done.  


## Instructions to Run the Automation Code
1. **Main Code Location:**
   The primary automation code is located within the `src/test/java` directory. This directory contains the Java test classes that constitute your automation suite.
2. **Executing the TestNG Suite:**
   - Navigate to the `target` directory in your project structure.
   - Inside the `target` directory, you will find a file named `testng.xml`.
   - Right-click on the `testng.xml` file and select "Run As" -> "TestNG Suite."
   The TestNG test suite will now commence execution, running the specified test cases.
3. **Monitoring Test Execution:**
   - During the execution, TestNG will execute the defined test methods as per your test classes.
   - Monitor the progress as the automation tests run. The duration may vary based on the number and complexity of your test cases.
4. **Generating TestNG Report:**
   - After the completion of the test execution, you will observe that a test report is automatically generated. This report will be available in the "report" folder.
5. **Accessing the TestNG Report:**
   - To view the test report, navigate to the "report" folder.
   - Right-click on the "report" folder and select "Open with" -> "WebBrowser."
   The TestNG report will be displayed in your web browser, providing you with comprehensive insights into the test results, including pass/fail status, detailed logs, and any additional information configured within your test classes.
6. **Review and Analysis:**
   Inside the TestNG report, you can thoroughly review the outcomes of your test cases. Identify any test failures or issues and extract detailed information about the test execution.
